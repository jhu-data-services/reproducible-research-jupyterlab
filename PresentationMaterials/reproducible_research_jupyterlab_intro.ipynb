    "> \"Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. **The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.**\" - Donald Knuth"
